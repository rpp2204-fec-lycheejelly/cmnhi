Make a branch for your feature
Implement feature changes
Git add .; git commit; git push origin [branch-name]
DO NOT PUSH TO MAIN/MASTER
from GitHub, make pull request, but do not merge
If working on another feature, git checkout master and make another branch
Someone will review code, either approve and merge, or tell them to make changes
If there is a merge conflict, the merger should checkout their branch, git pull origin main, manually fix the merges, push to origin [branch-name], make another pull request to merge with main
If that didn't work, set the repo on fire and cry
