<br>Make a branch for your feature
<br>Implement feature changes
<br>Git add .; git commit; git push origin [branch-name]
<br>DO NOT PUSH TO MAIN/MASTER
<br>from GitHub, make pull request, but do not merge
<br>If working on another feature, git checkout master and make another branch
<br>Someone will review code, either approve and merge, or tell them to make changes
<br>If there is a merge conflict, the merger should checkout their branch, git pull origin main, manually fix the merges, push to origin [branch-name], make another pull request to merge with main
<br>If that didn't work, set the repo on fire and cry
